# SUMOGRID - a basic sass grid
**SUMOGRID** is a basic grid system written in SASS with full customization. You can say how many columns you want to use and how big your *gutter* should be. I wrote this basically for me. I don't use any Front-End Frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or other because I love writing code by myself that everyone still will understand. If you don't like this, don't use it. If you use it, I love you. You can give me feedback anytime and report some features if you want to have more.

## What's in it?
Basic files. Almost. Most important is the settings file which looks like this:
```scss
$grid-columns: 12; // some use more columns some want to use less.
$grid-gutter: 1.5%; // spaces between each column (right and left).
$grid-width: 100% / $grid-columns; // you won't have to change this.
```

## Any License?
Yes. I published this code under the [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. You can do what ever you want with the code but have in mind to leave the attribution.

I won't update **SUMOGRID** anymore, after I found myself a better grid. Go check out [Jeet.gs](http://jeet.gs/).

# sumogrid

This is a basic SCSS function which generates a small and simple grid system for your project.

## Customize
```scss
$grid-columns: 12; // some use more columns some want to use less.
$grid-gutter: 1.5%; // spaces between each column (right and left).
$grid-width: 100% / $grid-columns; // you won't have to change this.
```
